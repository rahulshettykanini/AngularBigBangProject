  <h1>WHAT IS CARDIOLOGY?</h1>
</div> 

<div>
  <p id="intro1">
      Cardiology is a branch of medicine that deals with disorders of the 
      heart and the cardiovascular system. The field includes medical diagnosis 
      and treatment of congenital heart defects, coronary artery disease,
      heart failure, valvular heart disease and electrophysiology.

  Diagnostic Electrophysiology studies
  The electrophysiology study is a test conducted to examine the electrical system or activity of the heart
   and detect any abnormal heartbeats or arrhythmia. The electrical activity is measured by advancing 
   catheters   and wire electrodes through blood vessels that enter the heart. We take every possible care 
   to ensure that your test remains uncomplicated. Several medications may be given to the patients
    intravenously to sedate the part but they don't otherwise pose a threat to your body.
  
  Catheter Ablation of Arrhythmias
  This procedure uses radiofrequency energy to destroy a small part of the heart tissue responsible
   for causing rapid and irregular heartbeats. Catheter ablation is used for the treatment of arrhythmias
  only when medicines are ineffective or not tolerated. At Narayana, the best cardiology hospital in India,
  Catheter ablation is sometimes done through open-heart surgery, but it's often done using catheters, 
  to make the procedure less invasive and shortening recovery times.
